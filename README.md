# Scope
BudgetTracker is a personal side project that aims to make tracking expenses and incomes easier and less time consuming.
For now this is only a cli-app, it has functionalities to add/remove/modify transactions and to print/visualize the situation at the moment.

# First time running
The first time it's run, it will create a SQL database and prompt the user for the inital amount of money in the account.

# TODO
- in the future BT will probably also have a GUI.
- also plan to give the possibility of adding more than one account/saving account.
